## Background

[CRA (create-react-app)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provides a first-class React developer experience. For building single-page web apps, it's not only the fastest boostrapâ€“â€“it's also the most carefully-curated, well-supported, and feature-fledged. There is a downside, however: in an effort to create stability and simplicity for beginners, it excludes many configuration options and newer technologies (such as Babel transformations based on early-stage [TC39](https://github.com/tc39) proposals). CRA comes with an "eject" script whichâ€“â€“once irreversibly runâ€“â€“allows customization of the "start", "build", and "test" scripts, along with their corresponding configurations. While this does allow you some DX freedom, it isn't always preferable; ejection makes it impossible to upgrade to new versions of `react-scripts`, and it exposes a lot of tedious, knarly-lookin' code. Rescripts is for developers who don't want to eject or worry about configuration, but still want to use cutting-edge developer tooling.

Tim Arney's [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) wasâ€“â€“in my humble opinionâ€“â€“the first piece of open source to successfully and reliably solve this problem with CRA. On top of offering a solution, it led to many "rewires" (community-made plugins for simpler setup). Butâ€“â€“when CRA 2.0 came aroundâ€“â€“there were some breaking changes. Not to mention, the react-app-rewired DX was something to be further simplified. And now... without further adieu.. enter Rescripts.

Rescripts tackles this same probem for CRA 2.0+ in a way that is compatible with rewires built for react-app-rewired. It introduces a default "rescript" (similar to a rewire) which automatically scans your project for the existence of ESLint and Babel configurations. Rescripts are loaded in a modular style, with a DX similar to that of Babel preset loading. The default rescript also installs must-have optimizations, which result in higher lighthouse scores (aka. better performance and shorter load times). Rescripts is highly configurable, yet can be used in two (extremely simple) steps. If you end up liking this library, please tweet at [@gearon](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) requesting a `rescripts-everything-i-did-not-include` package ðŸ¤©

## Installation

Install `@rescripts/cli` as a dev dependency.

```sh
yarn add -D @rescripts/cli
```

## Basic Usage

#### 1) Replace `react-scripts` calls with `rescripts` calls

```diff
{
  "name": "built-with-rescripts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
+   "@rescripts/cli": "^0.1.0"
  }
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
+   "start": "rescripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
+   "build": "rescripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test",
+   "test": "rescripts test",
-   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",
    "not op_mini all"
  ]
}
```

#### 2) Add custom Babel & ESLint configs

Add custom configurations for Babel and/or/nor ESLint at your project's root directory. For file name, use whatever convention you prefer:

**Babel:** `.babelrc`, `.babelrc.js`, `.babelrc.json`, or `babel.config.js`

**ESLint:** `.eslint`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, or `eslint.config.js`

Or specify the configuration in your package.json:

```diff
{
  "name": "built-with-rescripts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rescripts/cli": "^0.1.0"
  }
  "scripts": {
    "start": "rescripts start",
    "build": "rescripts build",
    "test": "rescripts test"
  },
+ "eslintConfig": {
+   "extends": "react-app",
+   "rules": {
+     "some-rule": [1, "always"]
+   }
+ },
+ "babel": {
+   "presets": [
+     "react-app"
+   ],
+   "plugins": [
+     "some-babel-plugin"
+   ]
+ }
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",
    "not op_mini all"
  ]
}
```

Note: when specifying the destination of a config/preset from your package.json, you cannot specify an rc file (only accepts js or json formats).

#### Specifying ESLint plugin & config paths

When specifying ESLint plugin & config paths, be sure to wrap the path with `require.resolve` (might need to convert your file to an `.eslintrc.js` or `eslint.config.js`). You don't need to do this for your Babel configurations (Babel handles module resolution by recursively tracking the parent preset path).

This `.eslintrc.js`, for instance...

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: './path/to/config/.eslint-config.js',
}
```

... will produce the following error...

```sh
Failed to compile.

./src/index.js
Error: Cannot find module 'eslint-config-path/to/config/.eslint-config.js'  . In /Users/harrysolovay/Desktop/rescripts/packages/examples/basic/.babel-preset.js
Referenced from:
    at Array.reduceRight (<anonymous>)
```

..., which can be fixed with...

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: require.resolve('./path/to/config/.eslint-config.js'),
}
```

Although you don't need to do this for your babel configuration paths, it's recommended:

`.babelrc.js`

```js
const {BABEL_ENV} = process.env

{
  "preset": [
    "react-app",
    BABEL_ENV === 'development'
      ? require.resolve('./.babelrc.dev.js')
      : require.resolve('./.babelrc.prod.js')
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Processes

Rescripts exposes the three main configurable processes of CRA:

1. **Webpack** is responsible for both development and production builds. This is likely where the bulk of your rescripting will go.
2. **Development server**
3. **Jest**â€“â€“Rescripts takes care of prepping any custom babel configuration to play well with Jest. If you look at [the testing script](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts/test.js) in `react-scripts`, you'll find comments about plans for a more stable replacement. Keyboard blood & tears may ensue. Please file issues!

### Configuration

#### The "Root Rescript"

By default, rescripts will look for a rescripts.js file in the root directory of your app. This file (a "rescript") should export an object with any combination of the following:

| property    | type & return                                 | description                                                                                                | purpose                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rescripts` | Array\<string> => void                        | Relative or node modules paths to other "rescripts" to be applied before the current (in sequential order) | Allows for a more modular composition of rescripts                                                                                                       |  |
| `webpack`   | WebpackConfig => Modified                     | This function takes in the webpack configuration, transforms it, and returns the new config                | Allows you to edit your Webpack development and production configurations as a single object                                                             |  |
| `devServer` | () => (proxy, allowedHost) => DevServerConfig | Returns a function that calls the supplied (via sole argument) function and returns the altered value      | decide how you want your development server to behaveâ€“â€“alternatively, disable this and create your own (for instance with a little docker + NGINX magic) |  |
| `jest`      | Array\<FillInLater>                           |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                          |  |

#### Example rescript

`rescript-example.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  rescripts: [
    // composing rescripts from node_modules
    require('@rescripts/rescript-default'),
    require('@rescripts/rescript-lighthouse'),
    // relative paths will also work
    require('./path/to/rescript'),
  ],
  webpack: config => {
    // good practice to create (and later on return) a copy of the original
    const reconfig = {...config}
    // edit the config (in this example, we disable webpack's caching mechanism)
    reconfig.module.rules[2].oneOf[1].options.cacheDirectory = false
    // return the updated config
    return reconfig
  },
  devServer: configFn => (proxy, allowedHost) => ({
    // destructure the options returned
    ...configFn(proxy, allowedHost),
    // and override the headers to enable CORS
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers':
        'X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Authorization',
    },
  }),
}
```

Note: rescripts are applied before the rescript in which they are specified (in sequential order). In the example above rescripts get applied like this:

1. `@rescripts/rescript-default`
2. `@rescripts/rescript-lighthouse`
3. `./path/to/rescript`
4. `rescript-example.js`

#### Point to your rescript(s)

By default, rescripts will scan your project's root directory for a "rescripts.js" file. You can also explicitly point to a rescript from your `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "name": "built-with-rescripts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rescripts/cli": "^0.1.0"
  }
  "scripts": {
    "start": "rescripts start",
    "build": "rescripts build",
    "test": "rescripts test"
  },
+ "rescripts": "path/to/rescript",
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",
    "not op_mini all"
  ]
}
```

... or point to a rescript in node_modules:

```diff
+ "rescripts": "@rescripts/rescript-lighthouse",
```

... or point to multiple rescripts:

```diff
+ "rescripts": [
+   "@rescripts/rescript-default",
+   "@rescripts/rescript-lighthouse"
+ ],
```

#### Webpack-only

If your reconfiguration targets Webpack only, your rescript can directly export the Webpack function:

```js
module.exports = config => {
  const reconfig = {...config}
  // do something to `reconfig`
  return reconfig
}
```

#### Development vs. Production

To differentiate between development and production reconfiguration, go ahead and reference environment variables as necessary. For example:

```js
module.exports => {
  "rescript": [
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' &&
      require('@rescripts/rescript-image-compression')
  ]
}
```

## Rescripts

- [rescript-default](https://github.com) â€“ scans for Babel and ESLint configurations and uses them if preset
- [rescript-lighthouse](https://github.com) â€“ optimizations for higher lighthouse scores
- [rescript-image-compression](https://github.com) â€“ compresses your images
