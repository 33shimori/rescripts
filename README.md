## Background

[CRA (create-react-app)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provides a first-class React developer experience. For building single-page web apps, it's not only the fastest boostrapâ€“â€“it's also the most carefully-curated, well-supported, and feature-fledged. There is a downside, however: in an effort to create stability and simplicity for beginners, its creators excluded many configuration options and newer technologies (such as Babel transformations based on early-stage [TC39](https://github.com/tc39) proposals). CRA comes with an "eject" script whichâ€“â€“once irreversibly runâ€“â€“allows customization of the "start", "build", and "test" scripts, along with their corresponding configurations. While this does allow you some DX freedom, it isn't always preferable; ejection makes it impossible to upgrade to new versions of `react-scripts`, and it exposes a lot of tedious, knarly-lookin' code. Rescripts is for developers who don't want to eject or worry about configuration, but still want to use cutting-edge tools.

Tim Arney's [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) was the first project to successfully tackle this problem. It offered a solution that led to many "rewires" (community-made plugins for simpler setup). Butâ€“â€“when CRA 2.0 came aroundâ€“â€“there were some breaking changes. Not to mention, the react-app-rewired DX was something to be further simplified.

Rescripts tackles this same probem for CRA 2.0+ with several key DX differences. First off, it was designed to be more of a focal point for all non-standard configuration. The underlaying loader can handle deeply nested "rescripts" (conceptually similar to babel plugins), all of which can modify any CRA process. The API also exposes a middleware entry, so that you can track your configurations as they are transformed. It should also be noted that Rescripts is compatible with many Webpack rewires built for react-app-rewired.

If you like this framework, please tweet at [@gearon](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) requesting a `everything-i-did-not-include` rescript!

## Installation

#### Install `@rescripts/cli` as a dev dependency:

```sh
yarn add -D @rescripts/cli
```

#### Install the rescript(s) you wish to use:

```sh
yarn add -D @rescripts/rescript-env
```

> @rescripts/rescript-env scans your `package.json` & project root for Babel, ESLint and TSLint configuration files. If present, these configurations will override the CRA defaults.

## Basic Usage

#### 1) Replace `react-scripts` calls with `rescripts` calls

`package.json`

```diff
{
  "name": "built-with-rescripts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
  }
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rescripts/cli": "^0.0.3",
    "@rescript/rescript-env"
  }
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
+   "start": "rescripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
+   "build": "rescripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test",
+   "test": "rescripts test",
-   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",
    "not op_mini all"
  ]
}
```

#### 2) Define a 'rescripts' field and specify which to use

`package.json`

```diff
{
  "name": "built-with-rescripts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
  }
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rescripts/cli": "^0.1.0"
  }
  "scripts": {
    "start": "rescripts start",
    "build": "rescripts build",
    "test": "rescripts test"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
  },
  "browserslist": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",
    "not op_mini all"
  ],
+ "rescripts": [
+   "env"
+ ]
}
```

You can also specify your "root rescript" in a root-level `.rescriptsrc` file (use whatever convention you prefer: `.js`, `.json`, or no extension.)

#### 3) Use the newly-enabled feature(s)

In the case of [@rescripts/rescript-env](https://github.com/rescripts/rescripts/blob/master/packages/rescripts/env), you will now be able to use custom Babel, ESLint and TSLint configurations. Use any of the following conventions:

**Babel:** place config inside of a root-level `.babelrc`, `.babelrc.js`, `.babelrc.json`, or `babel.config.js` file, or inside of the `babel` field of your `package.json`

**ESLint:** place config inside of a root-level`.eslintrc`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, or `eslint.config.js` file, or inside of the `eslintConfig` field of your `package.json`

**TSLint:** place config inside of a root-level`tslint.js` or `tslint.json` file

## Advanced Usage

Your root rescript should be an array of other rescripts. Some rescripts take in options and/or other parameters. Some do not. Some contain functions that transform your webpack config. Some contain transformations for any combination of processes (`webpack`, `devServer` and `jest`). Consider the following:

In this example, the root rescript makes reference to [@rescripts/rescript-env](https://github.com/rescripts/rescripts/blob/master/packages/rescripts/env). This rescript takes in no arguments, which means that it has to scan your project at every run.

```js
module.exports = ['env']
```

Alternatively, you could use [@rescripts/rescript-use-babel-config](https://github.com/rescripts/rescripts/blob/master/packages/rescripts/use-babel-config) and [@rescripts/rescript-use-eslint-config](https://github.com/rescripts/rescripts/blob/master/packages/rescripts/use-eslint-config) (or [@rescripts/rescript-use-tslint-config](https://github.com/rescripts/rescripts/blob/master/packages/rescripts/use-tslint-config) if you prefer TypeScript):

```js
module.exports = [
  ['use-babel-config', '.babelrc'],
  ['use-eslint-config', '.eslintrc'],
]
```

This example illustrates how arguments can be passed to a rescript by wrapping its reference inside of another array and adding the arguments as subsequent elements.

The eventual goal of Rescripts is to provide a single, simple interface for deep customizations:

`.rescriptsrc.js`

```json
(module.exports = [
  [
    "use-babel-config",
    {
      "presets": ["react-app"],
      "plugins": [
        "react-require",
        [
          "module-resolver",
          {
            "root": ".",
            "alias": {
              "~": "./src"
            }
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  ],
  [
    "use-eslint-config",
    {
      "extends": ["react-app"],
      "plugins": ["ramda"],
      "rules": {
        "ramda/compose-pipe-style": "error",
        "react/react-in-jsx-scope": 0
      }
    }
  ]
])
```

## Rescript Structure

Rescripts transform the default configurations used by the three main processes of CRA (webpack, its developement server, and test-running via Jest). Rescripts can do much more though, such as writing logs, caching files, commiting changes and triggering other processes.
